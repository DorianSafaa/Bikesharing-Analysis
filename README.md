## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to analyze NYC bike-sharing data from August 2017 for the purpose of starting a similar project in De Moines. We used Tableau to visualize the data to figure out how the bike share business actually works in NYC, and to create a proposal on how it might work in De Moines.
