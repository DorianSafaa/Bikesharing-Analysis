# Bike-sharing

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to analyze NYC bike-sharing data from August 2017 for the purpose of starting a similar project in De Moines. We used Tableau to visualize the data to figure out how the bike share business actually works in NYC, and to create a proposal on how it might work in De Moines. 

## Results

The results of the analysis are: 

-2,344,224 bike trips were recorded during the month of August. 

-81% of the riders are annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service.
