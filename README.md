# Bike-sharing

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to analyze NYC bike-sharing data from August 2017 for the purpose of starting a similar project in De Moines. We used Tableau to visualize the data to figure out how the bike share business actually works in NYC, and to create a proposal on how it might work in De Moines. 

## Results

The results of the analysis are: 

- 2,344,224 bike trips were recorded during the month of August. 

- 81% of the riders are annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service.

- 65% of riders are male

The peak hours for bike trips during the month of August are 8:00am and between 5:00pm and 6:00pm.

Even though the are some exceptions but we can clearly see that the younger the riders are the longer trip they make.

The majority of the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders in less than an hour..

## Summary

We can conclude from this analysis that August is a busy month for the bike sharing business. The peak hours are around 8:00am and between 5:00pm and 6:00pm. That means we need to have enough bikes during this time to accomodate all our customers. In addition, most of the bikes are used for less than an hour during each trip. That can help us have an estimate of the repair cost of the bikes. Also, since the lowest hours are between 3:00am and 4:00am, we can use this time to do bike repairing.
